# OpenWork Server

Filesystem-backed API for OpenWork remote clients. This package provides the OpenWork server layer described in `apps/app/pr/openwork-server.md` and is intentionally independent from the desktop app.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g openwork-server
openwork-server --workspace /path/to/workspace --approval auto
```

`openwork-server` ships as a compiled binary, so Bun is not required at runtime.

Or from source:

```bash
pnpm --filter openwork-server dev -- \
  --workspace /path/to/workspace \
  --approval auto
```

The server logs the client token and host token on boot when they are auto-generated.

Add `--verbose` to print resolved config details on startup. Use `--version` to print the server version and exit.

## Desktop task recovery

The desktop enables `resumeInterruptedTasks` when embedding a server that owns
its local engines. Standalone servers, attached engines, remote workspaces, and
read-only servers do not opt in. Recovery works with both OpenCode v1 and v2 and
does not depend on an open conversation tab.

The `desktop_task_recovery` table in the existing runtime SQLite database stores
up to 1,000 task identities, their workspace path, original engine, last observed
user turn, and recovery phase. It stores no prompts, transcripts, or credentials.
Only tasks admitted after this feature is enabled are tracked; old unfinished
conversations are not swept or resumed retroactively.

On quit or update, a final checkpoint runs before engine teardown with two task
snapshots in flight and a 10-second budget. On restart, the coordinator checks two task
snapshots every two seconds and admits at most one continuation every two seconds,
with at most two recovered tasks active. Already-active native runs are observed,
not re-prompted, and native active work also limits new recovery admissions.

Completed, archived, manually stopped, approval/question-blocked, and active
delegated work are excluded. New manual work invalidates the old recovery intent.
Missing workspaces, changed directories, unavailable policy, and unverified
snapshots never authorize a send. V1 requires the original user turn and model
in its recent 100-message snapshot; v2 keeps the session's native model. A
continuation asks to inspect completed effects first, not rerun the original prompt.

A send is claimed durably before admission. Lost acknowledgements are never
blindly retried, even after another restart. Crash recovery requires an observed
running task and a still-unfinished matching turn; unexplained aborts stay stopped.
Tasks whose admission or shutdown checkpoint cannot be confirmed remain manual.
This prevents duplicate recovery admissions, not exactly-once execution of external
tools; uncertain earlier effects must be inspected or clarified before continuing.

Desktop Automation and remote-command requests opt out with
`x-openwork-task-recovery: off`; their existing execution ownership is unchanged.
Runtime journey verification for actual Electron restarts on both engines remains
separate from the focused coordinator and mocked-proxy tests.

## Config file

Defaults to `~/.config/openwork/server.json` (override with `OPENWORK_SERVER_CONFIG` or `--config`).

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8787,
  "approval": { "mode": "manual", "timeoutMs": 30000 },
  "workspaces": [

      "name": "Finance",
      "workspaceType": "local",
      "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4096",
      "directory": "/Users/susan/Finance"
    }
  ],
  "corsOrigins": ["http://localhost:5173"]
}
```

## Endpoints

- `GET /health`
- `GET /status`
- `GET /capabilities`
- `GET /whoami`
- `GET /workspaces`
- `GET /workspace/:id/config`
- `PATCH /workspace/:id/config`

- `DELETE /tokens/:id`

Inbox/outbox:

- `POST /workspace/:id/inbox` (multipart upload into `.opencode/openwork/inbox/`)

- `GET /experimental/ui-control/pending` (collaborator or owner bearer token; optional `?wait=1`)
- `POST /experimental/ui-control/:id/reply` (collaborator or owner bearer token)

Desktop and web renderers poll the same server they are connected to. The first
polling window claims each request; commands are never broadcast to every tab.
Requests expire after five seconds, and a server with no recent renderer poll
returns an explicit no-window result. The external desktop UI MCP bridge remains
available; in-app tools no longer discover or fall back to that bridge.

OpenCode proxy:

- `GET|POST|... /opencode/*`
- `GET|POST|... /w/:id/opencode/*`

## Approvals

All writes are gated by host approval.

Host APIs accept either:

- `X-OpenWork-Host-Token: <token>` (legacy host token), or
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` where the token scope is `owner`.

Approvals endpoints:

- `GET /approvals`
- `POST /approvals/:id` with `{ "reply": "allow" | "deny" }`

Set `OPENWORK_APPROVAL_MODE=auto` to auto-approve during local development.

## Automatic title recovery

The managed v1 engine ships a title-only compatibility plugin. If a provider
returns HTTP 400 with `unsupported_value` or `unsupported_parameter` for
`reasoning.effort`, `reasoning_effort`, `temperature`, or `top_p`, it makes at
most one corrected request. It uses a reported supported effort or omits the
rejected optional parameter so the same model can use its default. Provider,
model, credentials, conversation content, and normal chat options stay intact.
Access, quota, transport, and unrelated request errors do not trigger an added
recovery request. The engine's own transport retry policy still applies.

Engine log records with service `openwork.title` / message `Automatic title
generation` contain only session/provider/model IDs, outcome, recovery attempt,
HTTP status, and the rejected parameter name. `accepted_after_recovery` means
the provider accepted the retry; `title_available` separately confirms a real
title was observed in a session update. An accepted request with no title update
within 60 seconds is `title_unconfirmed`, which can mean empty output, a stream
failure, or missing persistence; it is not reported as success. The app's
existing bounded placeholder probes and warning remain the user-facing safety
net. Existing untitled conversations are not bulk-regenerated.
